# **0x1D. C - Binary trees**

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering program** at ***Alx-Africa***. It aims to learn about what is a binary tree, the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree and the different types of binary trees (complete, full, perfect and balanced).

## **Technologies & Requirements**

-  Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- Code should use the Betty style
